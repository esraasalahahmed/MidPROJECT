# MidPROJECT
This project analyse the patterns of customer spendings on three related product categories in Germany, France, United Kingdom and United States and check is the business operate the same way in the four countires. 
We test the hypothises that the average profit and average revenue are the same in the four contries using ANOVA test. 
Our hypothesis have been rejected, and it appeared that at least there are two countries have different average profit and revenue. 
The data covered two years (2015 and 2016) and there was an increase in average profit in all countries in 2016. 
Customer age play a significant role,as it showed that profits generated from difffernt age group in each country. However, customer gender play no role, there was no considerable differences between females and males. 
The product category -Bikes- generate the highest revenue in all countries, but in terms of profit clothing is the most profitable. 
The business seems not running well in USA compared to the other 3 countries. Considering the cost revenue ration, it shows that Germany has the lowest ratio while USA has the highest. (the lowest the ratio the better) 
Also, the ratio showed that Accesories as a product category has the highst ratio.
Checking the profit by month, it appears that the begnning of the year is more profitable from (January to July).
